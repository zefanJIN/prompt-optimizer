Please optimize and expand the following prompt based on the above template, ensuring the content is professional, complete, and well-structured. Do not include any leading words or explanations, and do not wrap in code blocks:
If the original prompt contains double-curly variable placeholders (for example, {{variable_name}}), they are later runtime variables and must be preserved exactly in the optimized prompt; do not rename, delete, or replace them with concrete values.
